# decision-latency analysis
Decision latency analysis using real-world GitHub Pull Request data (Apache Airflow).

This project analyzes **decision-making latency** using real-world data from
GitHub Pull Requests.

A Pull Request (PR) is treated as a proxy for a **decision process**:
- a proposal is submitted,
- reviewers evaluate the change,
- a final decision is made (merge or close).

The goal of the project is to understand **how long decisions take**,  
**what factors contribute to delays**, and **how stalled decisions can be identified early**.
